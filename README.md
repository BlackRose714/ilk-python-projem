🐍 My First Python Projects

This repository contains my very first Python projects as part of my learning journey. I'm building simple yet functional applications to get started with programming.

📌 Projects

1. 🎟 Ticket Price Calculator

A Python program that calculates ticket prices based on age, height, student status, and discount coupon availability.

Features:

Checks eligibility based on age and height

Applies discount for students

Applies additional discount if a coupon code is entered

Displays the final ticket price with the user's name


Concepts Used:

input() for user input

int() for type casting

if / else conditional structures

lower() to handle case-insensitive input

Formatted strings (f"") for output


How to Use:

1. Run the program


2. Enter name, age, height, student status, and coupon info


3. View the calculated ticket price
